## Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- **Zustand** for authentication state (persistent)
- **React Query** for server state with caching
- **Local state** for UI interactions

### Routing Strategy
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Dynamic imports for code splitting (future enhancement)
- Proper navigation guards and redirects

### Component Architecture  
- **Atomic design** with ui/ folder for base components
- **Feature-based** organization for complex components
- **Custom hooks** for business logic separation

### Performance
- **Image optimization** with responsive sources
- **Lazy loading** for media content
- **Query optimization** with React Query
- **Bundle splitting** ready for production
